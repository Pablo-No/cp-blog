Hi!

My name is Pablo SÃ¡ez Reyes and I'm currently a second year math major and computer science major student at Polythecnic University of Catalonia.

One of my main hobbies is competitive programming. My username on most competitive programming platforms is Pablo-No, here are some links to my profiles:

- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/profile/Pablo-No)
- [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/users/PabloNo)
- [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/users/pablo_no)

Some of my achievements include a bronze medal at IOI 2023 and being world finalist at ICPC 2024.

This blog is a way to share some ideas, alternative solutions to problems, or anything related to Competitive Programming.
